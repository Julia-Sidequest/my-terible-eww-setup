this is my terible eww setup
it very much is a work in progress 

it runs on "eww" https://github.com/elkowar/eww 

to run it copy everything in this file to ./config/eww 

If you want to use the weather client you will need to enter your latitude and longitude into latlon.txt 

befor first run you need to make everyting executable with: cmod +x ewwstar.sh; cd scripts; chmod +x blacklist.sh music.sh weather.sh 

then run it with: bash ewwstart.sh
