this is my terible eww setup
it very much is a work in progress 

it runs on "eww" https://github.com/elkowar/eww 

to run it copy everything in this file to ./config/eww 
and then bash ewwstart.sh 

If you want to use the weather client you will need to enter your latitude and longitude into latlon.txt
